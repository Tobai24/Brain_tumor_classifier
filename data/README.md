# 📊 Dataset Overview

### About the Dataset

This dataset is sourced from **[Kaggle’s Brain Tumor Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset/data)**, which is a combination of three datasets:

1. **[Figshare Dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427)** 🧠
2. **[Brain Tumor Classification Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri)** 🧑‍⚕️
3. **[Brain Tumor Detection Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection)** 🔬

The dataset contains **7023 human brain MRI images** classified into **4 categories**:

- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **No Tumor**
- **Pituitary**

This dataset will be used to build a **multiclass classification model** to predict the presence and type of brain tumor based on MRI images using deep learning techniques, particularly focusing on CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)

## Downloading the Dataset

Due to the large size of the dataset, I have included the necessary code in the `data.ipynb` notebook to download the data directly from Kaggle. 📥 Please follow the instructions in the notebook to download the dataset to your local machine.

## Usage

Once the dataset is downloaded, you can either move it to the `data` directory within the project or use it directly from its download location. 📂
